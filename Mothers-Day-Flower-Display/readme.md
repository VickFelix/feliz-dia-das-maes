# Flower Display Explosion!
This JavaScript application explodes a flower display to revile a mother's day message! This works both on Mobile and Desktop web browsers.

## How it was made
The project uses JQuery, CSS and HTML to produce the explosion effect, with the use of actual trajectory calculations to give a genuine explosive feel.
